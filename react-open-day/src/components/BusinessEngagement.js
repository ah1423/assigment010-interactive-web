        <p>The benefits of presenting to our students include:</p>
      <li>meeting a target audience face-to-face and answering their questions</li>
      <li>increased brand awareness</li>
      <li>sharing your company vision, culture and values</li>
      <li>exploring how theory is being applied in practice</li>

      <h4>Inviting students to conferences, meetings, network groups</h4>
      <p>Our students really appreciate the opportunities based in industry, whether that is attending internal business meetings or accompanying businesses to regional/national or international networking events or conferences. </p>
    <h4>Job/Career Fairs</h4>
    <p>Ready to meet your next talented employee? Our job fairs are free to attend and you can exhibit, present or even interview our students and graduates on the day.</p>

     <h4>Offering visits</h4>
     <p>Our students gain valuable insight when visiting business locations.  These in-depth visits allow you to showcase your products/services whilst raising brand awareness.   Your in-depth business experience provides exclusive first-hand account of the company’s life cycle, a unique opportunity students explore real-life thriving business models and develop an understanding of key challenges of your specific industry. </p>
      <h4>Pop-up stands</h4>
      <p>Promote your company with a pop-up stand in high footfall locations across our campus. Pop-up stands are a great way to interact with students at any time of the year and, unlike careers fairs, you don’t have to compete with other companies for students’ attention.</p>
