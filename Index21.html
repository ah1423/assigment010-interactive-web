                <h5>About This Course</h5>
                <p>What sets this course apart is its flexibility - with 16 optional modules to choose from in years 2 and 3. It is ideal if you are looking for a wide range of computing skills: from web design and development with PHP and JavaScript,
                    computer programming in languages such as C# and Python, mobile app coding in Java, and embedded systems with C++. You will develop skills in cyber security, database management and CISCO network systems support, and have the option
                    to study specialised subjects such as AI with Machine Learning and Big Data. We will help you develop a systematic, creative and flexible approach to problem solving that computing professionals rely on.</p>
                <p> The course is designed with modules to promote your professional growth and personal development. You will be encouraged to acquire key practical skills to help you build a broad base and deep knowledge of computing. This will allow
                    you to make informed choices when developing specialist in-depth knowledge in your preferred areas.</p>
                <p>Employability is a key focus with guest speakers from industry, practical case studies, vocational assignment scenarios and modules which have been developed alongside employers. We encourage entrepreneurs and will provide you with
                    the opportunity to gain the knowledge necessary to develop your own business ideas around the latest technical innovations. Students also take part in the Global Day of Code and Agile Peterborough events, along with regular sessions
                    for meeting professionals and build working relationships.
                </p>
                <p> The Major Project is your chance to develop expertise in a subject of your choice, which can form the centre-piece for your portfolio ready for future interviews. You will have the opportunity to demonstrate this work to industry professionals
                    at our annual exhibition of final year projects. Examples of previous projects include VR computer games, specialised applications of Drones and Raspberry Pi based systems such as digital weather stations and in-car diagnostic
                    dashboards.
                </p>
                <p>The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with other universities, a typical class size is under 30 students.</p>

                <P>APCL relates to learning completed through an earlier course of study. If you have previously completed a course which is relevant to your proposed course you should make this clear when you apply. For this to be eligible for consideration
                    you must be able to provide certification, which shows your success in a final assessment for that course. Learning must be completed in the last five years or further evidence of updating will be required. Simple participation
                    in a course or an attendance certificate is not sufficient.
                </P>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR LEARNING (APL)</p>
                <P>We offer students flexibility in their studies, by recognising learning they may have completed elsewhere before they apply. The Accreditation of Prior Learning process ensures that we can take this into account when determining the
                    modules you must study. It is important that you identify any relevant prior learning when you apply. If your previous study specifically relates to modules on the course you wish to undertake we may approve a reduced programme
                    of study, thus shortening the time it takes to obtain your award. Where this relates to learning completed through an earlier course of study, this is called Prior Certificated Learning, and where learning has been achieved through
                    relevant work or experience, this is referred to as Prior Experiential Learning. Claims must be approved before you commence a course.</P>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">EXEMPTIONS BASED ON ACCREDITATION OF PRIOR EXPERIENTIAL CERTIFICATED LEARNING (APEL)
                </p>
                <P>It is important to understand that the APEL process does not award academic credit for experience alone, but for learning which can be shown to have been achieved through that experience. Students are required to prepare an individual
                    case for the credit arising from their learning experiences. This normally means that a student receives support in the preparation of a portfolio, which evidences their claimed exemptions for entry. This portfolio of evidence
                    is then submitted for assessment and the possible award of academic credit. Alternative methods of assessment of evidence may be available but needs to be discussed with the Admissions team or Course Leader.</P>

                          <p>Database development is fundamental in the area of computing and IT within organisational contexts. Database Management
                              Systems (DBMS) provide the systems, tools and interfaces by which the organisation can manage their information and use it
                              to assist in the effective running of the organisation. Databases offer many links to other areas such as programming, systems
                              analysis, HCI, as well as embracing issues of compatibility and end-user interfacing.</p>
                          <p>This module builds on the fundamentals of database design from Level 4 giving students opportunities to develop an
                              understanding of the concepts and issues relating to databases and database design as well as the practical skills to translate
                              that understanding into the design and creation of complex databases.</p>
                          <p>The students develop advanced design concepts based on Entity Relationship Diagrams and apply these to real-world cases.
                              They also develop their knowledge of SQL beyond basic queries by adding techniques such as outer joins, aggregation and
                              DDL. The students experience the multi-user aspect of databases by working with transactions.</p>
                          <p>The assessment comprises the design, production and querying of a database to meet a client's brief.</p>

                          <p>Students will also develop interactive websites using technologies such as JSON and XML, focusing of the data requirements
                              of modern websites and how this data is communicated between the front-end view and the back-end model.</p>
                          <p>Real world examples will be used to underpin understanding and to build on topics introduced in previous modules.</p>
                          <p>The module is assessed by the student building a solution to meet a brief, demonstrating their work to the class and delivering
                              a report which analyses similar public websites, justifies the student's design choices and evaluates their implementation.</p>

                                The module then looks at how networking devices are configured and how the data is switched and subsequently routed
                                between networks. Network security features are also considered.</p>
                            <p>There is a focus on how data can be handled discreetly and more securely by the implementing and configuring Virtual Local
                                Area Networks (VLAN). This knowledge is then extended so the network can be configured to allow inter VLAN routing to

                          <p>Object oriented programming is a programming language model organised around objects rather than actions and data rather
                              than logic. Industry dictates that the reuse of code is a fundamental skill required of graduates as this leads to cleaner, more
                              robust code. Object Oriented programming also facilitates the generation of Test Driven Development.</p>

                                for Internet or Intranet web sites. Building on from Introduction to Programming, web pages created with HTML, and scripting
                                languages access a database via SQL statements embedded in appropriate pages. It is expected that students will have a

                            <p>Whilst it is necessary that the student deliver a working web site without code errors, it is also a requirement that the design of
                                the pages is user centered. It is considered essential that the student understands the necessity for a web site, whether it is on
                                the Internet or Intranet, to be usable by its clients both internal and external.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the student is required to produce documentation that fully describes the web site such that others can easily
                                make future revisions. In order to understand the design of client / server web site it is necessary that the student researches
                                current design standards and existing related web sites.</p>

                            <p>Advanced programming relies upon design patterns and algorithms to implement efficient and robust software. Design
                                patterns and algorithms are commonly defined as reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems within software
                                implementations.
                                </p>
                            <p>Students will be introduced to advanced programming techniques using design patterns and algorithms, demonstrating how
                                and why their use facilitates the creation of robust efficient code.
                                </p>
                            <p>The knowledge of modern design patterns has become a key requirement for the development of software engineering
                                graduates. Therefore contemporary real-world scenarios will be utilised throughout the module, ensuring currency of
                                knowledge.

                            <p>This module provides students with a broad range of accepted design solutions for everyday software problems. Students will
                                select and implement advanced programming techniques for given scenarios. Key design patterns will be appraised such as
                                Singleton, FactoryObserver and Decorator; examples of algorithms explored might include sorting algorithms such as Divideand-conquer and Path finding. Implementation of these techniques will be via an appropriate object-oriented programming
                                language such as C#.

                                more advanced elements of network device configuration.</p>
                            <p>This module introduces the learner to static and dynamic routing theory and the protocols associated with this element of the
                                technology. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) will be used to create a routed network and further security features such as
                                Access Control Lists (ACL) will be presented. Network addressing features such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                                (DHCP) and Network Address Translation (NAT) are finally implemented to complete the network configuration.</p>
                            <p>The module is delivered as a mixture of theory, delivered through a series of lectures, and practical implementation, delivered
                                through a series of guided laboratory exercises. In the lab sessions students will gain a deep understanding on the routing and
                                switching concepts and acquire hands-on-skills using advanced network simulation tools that comply with industry standard

                            <p>This module allows students to engage in a substantial piece of individual research and product development work, focused
                                on a topic relevant to computing. The topic may be drawn from a variety of sources including:</p>
                            <p>Anglia Ruskin research groups,</p>

                            <p>The project topic will be assessed for suitability to ensure sufficient academic challenge and satisfactory supervision by an
                                academic member of staff. The chosen topic will require the student to identify / formulate problems and issues, conduct
                                literature reviews, evaluate information, investigate and adopt suitable development methodologies, determine solutions,
                                develop hardware, software and/or media artefacts as appropriate, process data, critically appraise and present their findings
                                using a variety of media.</p>
                            <p>Regular meetings with the project supervisor should take place, so that the project is closely monitored and steered in the right
                                direction. The project developed in this module is the most substantial piece of work that the student is producing during their
                                undergraduate studies. Thus, the choice of project topic and the quality of the work is likely to bear a great influence on the
                                student's career / employability. Therefore, the module will also include aspects of Personal Development Plan and CV
                                preparation. The students are strongly advised to allocate appropriate attention, time and effort to this module. The successful
                                completion of the module will increase students' employability, as they will acquire skills directly applicable to real world
                                projects as well as an artefact to show at job interviews.</p>

                                IT.</p>
                            <p>The ethical and professional responsibilities of IT graduates will be critically appraised.</p>
                            <p>The course covers relevant and current topics in Computer Law (e.g. Data Protection; Intellectual Property Law; Computer
                                Misuse) and other social, ethical and legal topics such as considering the causes and effects of computer systems failures</p>
                            <p>As a key element in developing their skills, students will work in small groups to present and lead whole-class seminars on
                                current IT issues.</p>
                            <p>Assessment is by delivering and leading (in groups of 3) a seminar to the whole class on an approved topic and also by an
                                individual report on an approved topic which critically analyses a current issue from a professional and ethical viewpoint.</p>

                                subjects. It takes its inspiration from human and other biological behaviour that exhibit intelligence, such as problem solving,
                                planning, decision making and optimization, and seeks to create systems that can perform similar intelligent tasks.</p>
                            <p>The students will explore the main areas of AI such as behaviour, genetic algorithms, neural networks and fuzzy logic. The
                                module is quite practical with an emphasis on implementing techniques in code. Some topics will extend over several weeks
                                to allow in-depth study.</p>
                            <p>The module assumes a basic level of mathematical ability and requires students to be familiar with a high-level programming

                                assets can be a critical success factor since data and information will often outlast the applications it was derived from
                                requiring the management of data and knowledge assets through time as applications, and even business processes change.</p>

                            <p>This module is based on the CCNA 3 element of the Cisco Routing & Switching course. It builds on the key concepts of
                                network switching and routing by focusing on the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in a larger
                                and more complex network.</p>
                            <p>The student will learn how to configure routers and switches for advanced functionality as well as troubleshoot operational
                                issues with areas such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Domain Name Service (DNS) & Spanning Tree
                                Protocol (STP).</p>
                            <p>The course will look at the operations and benefits of link aggregation and Cisco VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP) and offer
                                opportunities to compare and troubleshoot both STP & Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) operations.</p>
                            <p>By the end of this module, the student will be able to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches to resolve common
                                issues with Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), STP, and VTP in both
                                IPv4 and IPv6 networks.</p>
                            <p>The module is delivered as a mixture of theory, delivered through a series of lectures, and practical implementation, delivered
                                through a series of guided laboratory exercises. In the lab sessions students will gain deep understanding on the routing and
                                switching concepts and acquire hands-on-skills using advanced network simulation tools that comply with industry standard
                                router platforms.</p>
                                <p>Students studying this module will be able to access on-line materials including the Cisco Networking Academy online

                            <p>Over the past 20 years the world of computing has moved on from large static desk top machines to small, mobile embedded
                                devices. An embedded system is regarded as an application that contains at least one programmable computer (typically a
                                MCU, ASIC, or DSP) where the user are in the main unaware that the system is computer based.</p>
                            <p>This module will examine the key elements of embedded software development where engineers are faced with limited

                            <p>Students will engage with aspects of key learning theories and the ways in which they may be applied to designing the
                                structure and content of practical computer-based learning environments (CBLEs). The student will review and analyse a
                                range of CBLEs and the tools and technologies which underpin them, in particular developments in Web 2.0 applications. The
                                student will also be introduced to an analysis and development cycle suitable for the production of CBLEs 'fit for purpose' in a
                                practical educational environment to enable them to produce a suitable artefact which will be a CBLE or their choice.</p>
                            <p>The aspects of the module which are concerned with underpinning learning theory are assessed by means of a reflective 'blog'
                                linked to personal experience as a learner, peer discussion and collaboration, and research.</p>
                            <p>During in class lectures and seminars, students will collaborate and share ideas on a WIKI and on group forums, they will peer
                                review each other’s work and evidence that they have acted on feedback given, or justify why they took the decision not to.
                                Following this, the student should be able to synthesise the results of analysis, and their newly-acquired knowledge of the
                                possibilities of CBLEs, into an effective application of learning technologies. They will also be required to justify and evaluate
                                the prototype CBLE which they have developed, with regard to their chosen specific learning situation.</p>
                            <p>This module will help prepare the student to work in a variety of educational support roles, developing and maintaining CBLEs,
                                and working alongside teaching specialists to achieve optimal results in the application of learning technology. The student
                                may also use the experience of this module as a springboard for further educational study and a teaching / lecturing career or
                                as a learning technologist.</p>

                            <p>This module is based on the CCNA 4 element of the Cisco Routing & Switching curriculum. It builds on the Network Scaling
                                Module by focusing on the Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies and network services required by converged applications
                                in a complex network. In this module the student will learn about the selection criteria of network devices and WAN
                                technologies to meet network requirements.</p>
                            <p>The course will investigate different WAN technologies and their benefits as well as the operations and benefits of virtual
                                private networks (VPNs) and tunnelling. The student will learn how to configure and troubleshoot both serial and broadband
                                connections.</p>
                            <p>This module will also explore IPsec tunnelling operations as well as monitoring and troubleshooting network operations using
                                analytical tools such as syslog, SNMP, and NetFlow.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the module the student will be able to configure and troubleshoot network devices and resolve common issues
                                with data link protocols. Students will also develop the knowledge and skills needed to implement IPsec and Virtual Private
                                Network (VPN) operations in a complex network.</p>
                            <p>The module is delivered as a mixture of theory, delivered through a series of lectures, and practical implementation, delivered
                                through a series of guided laboratory exercises. In the lab sessions students will gain deep understanding on the routing and
                                switching concepts and acquire hands-on-skills using advanced network simulation tools that comply with industry standard
                                router platforms.</p>
                            <p>Students studying this module will be able to access on-line materials including the Cisco</p>
                            <p>Networking Academy online curriculum, the VLE, and access a specialist laboratory.</p>
